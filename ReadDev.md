This project is known as "KahootVersion5-Stable", it is called stable as it uses the primitive client spawner along with a traditional console stylized with chalk.

The said Kahoot client will spawn around ~100 processes that will join the Kahoot game for entertainment. The person who uses this client will be liable to their use of said client.
